# Gene ontology
The Gene Ontology (GO) knowledge base is the worldâ€™s largest source of information on the functions of genes
The functions are annotated to genes using GO terms in the format GO:1904469. The ontology is hierarchical, and annotations usually happen at leaf nodes so they need to get propagated

## Structure
The ontology has the following raw files:
* `goa_human.gaf`: file with the annotations Gene->GO Term
* `go.obo`: file with the hierarchical ontology, basically an directed acyclical graph
