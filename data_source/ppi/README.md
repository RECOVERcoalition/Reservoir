# Protein-protein interaction data
This type of data is usually collected from the individual websites. Some information is provided for each data source individually

## Biogrid
Curated PPIs from a variety of sources with referenced paper. There are two versions:
* Biogrid MV Physical: PPIs validated by multiple sources
* Biogrid Human: All of the Human PPIs

Data was downloaded from https://downloads.thebiogrid.org/BioGRID

## HuRI
The Human Reference Interactome is obtained by performing the same low-recall experiment 9 times to generate PPIs uniformly across the proteome.

Data was downloaded from http://www.interactome-atlas.org/download

## SNAP
Databases amalgamated from multiple other PPI-DBs, uncurated

Data was downloaded from http://snap.stanford.edu/multiscale-interactome/data/data.tar.gz

## String
NLP generated PPIs
